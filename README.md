# product-review-sentiment-analysis

##Project description
Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify
product reviews into one of three sen􀆟ment categories: posi􀆟ve, nega􀆟ve, or neutral. Sen􀆟ment
analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP)
and can provide valuable insights for businesses to understand customer opinions and sen􀆟ments
regarding their products.
